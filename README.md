# Valroant Tinder

## Motivation
#### The motivation for this project stemed a statistic that more than 85% of individuals that have played in an online game and have faced some sort of harrasment from teamates. 

## Description
#### My group and I have created a gamified teamate selection app that allows users to connect via inforamtion exchange once two users have matched. Users will be able to create a profile with tags and flairs that categorize that user. Once the profifle is created an dynamic algorithm on the backend will rate their against the other users and depending on the user's mathcing prferences then a list from best calculated user to worst calculated user is put into your object array and then the user will be able to swipe on these users. If a user is disliked then that user is removed from the list and we move onto the next. If a user is liked then that user is appended to a liked users list and then we check to see if this user is on the other users liked list and if so then we remove them from eachothers liked list and add them to eachothers match list. This mathch list is the list of users that you will be able to connect and communicate with via third praty platforms like discord.

## How to Install and Run
#### download the warsaw file into your local machine. Open the project file in your desired IDE (VScode is what I use). Make sure that you have Flask downlaoded and  when run the command 'flask run' which should start up the backend portion of the app. For the frontend we used an app called ExpoGo to host our server dynamically from one of our smart phones.

## How to Use
#### This app is not meant for production or anything that could resemble something on that scale. However, it does demonstrate full functionality of its dersired outcomes. If we hope to push this to deplyment one day then we will have to refactor some parts of the code like the data storage and also the hosting method.
